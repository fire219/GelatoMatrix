# GelatoMatrix
## Sweet and Simple, as it should be.

----------

No way around it: Current available Matrix clients suck. They're bloated, feature incomplete, have poor usability, or both. 

**Let's fix that.**

The *Gelato Matrix Project* (name TBD) will be simple. Easy to use. And easy to modify. Built in Python, not in Javascript entangled in absurd libraries and dependencies.
